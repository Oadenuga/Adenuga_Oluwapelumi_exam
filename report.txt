  objectives
1) On the approach to data cleaning to model deployment,
    Main objective is to build a predictive model and to build a one, my dataset was imported from as zip file from the link provided on the exam platform, i checked for the rows, shape, type of data. After this i checked for the missing values using white_wine.isna().sum() and  duplicated values using data.
    duplicated().i made sure my data was cleaned.univariate analysis was carried out to check for skewnees and correlation with the targets.
    After which the target features was mapped with categorical to descibe each digits
    Then the next step i took was to split my data using the train_test_split(80/20), scaling my dataset 
    using MinMaxScaler method. My dataset all numerical,cleaned was fit and suitable for model deployment


2)Base on my metrics of my model, according to my metrics From the classification report result, our model is more predictive at quality ;good'with precision and f1_score at 0.63 and 0.74 respectively respectively, 
whille our model tends to be predictive at quality 'average'  at quality average with precision and f1 score around 0.54 and 0.28 respectively.
quality 'bad and best' tends to have lowest quality because both the f1 and precison tends towards zero.
both average and good tends to higher predictive value.
in summary according to the metrics, our model is more predictive and price for good and average


3) Based on my model feature imortance or coefficients, the most features that would influence our wine quality alcohol quantity,and some few others features


4)How my result would help wine producers maximize profita, such as improing production consistency or identify key quality factors
